> ### Introduction
> A comprehensive eExam Management platform tailored for handling registration, payments, and results management for aptitude exams like GCAT and GCCT at UCSC. The system will allow candidates to register for multiple examinations, make payments online, receive notifications, and access their transcripts. The platform will also enable administrators to manage candidate records, payments, and results efficiently. This system is designed to be adaptable, allowing any institution to use it for managing exam-related processes without covering the actual examination delivery.
